Mining
======
Mining is the process of making computer hardware do mathematical calculations to confirm transactions for the Bitcoin network.

>*“Mining gives a very different kind of mental image of what we do. We are not mining, we are processing transactions and adding blocks to the blockchain.”* -
> Dr.Naveed Sherwani, CEO of PeerNova

### What is Bitcoin Mining?
* __Mining__ is the process of adding transaction records to Bitcoin's public ledger of past transactions.
* The __Blockchain__ stores past transactions in a pubic ledger, as it is a chain of blocks.
* A __Block__ is generated every 10 minutes, these blocks hold individual transactions.
